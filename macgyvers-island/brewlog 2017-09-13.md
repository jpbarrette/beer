* Used Yeast: Fermentis / Safale - American Ale Yeast US-05
* Strike water volume 11.85L, at 75.5C (calculated with [Brewersfriend.com calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/mash/), with ) 
* Mash temperature got down to 64C, I had to add boiling water to get back to 68C
* I rinsed the gains to get up to 24L of wort (calculated with liquid height: 24.5 cm)
* Preboil gravity was 1.032, estimated OG was 1.0432
* Duration of the boil was 90 minutes (Since estimated OG was low)
* A followed the recipe for hop addition. So late hop was added at flameout, waited 15 minutes, then added the cooler and the second hop addition.
* Amarillo hop was cones, and for the zero minute hop addition, I inadvertently added it without being in a hop bag, -15 minutes addition was in a hop bag. Because of the cones, I couldn't transfer the kettle content through the tap. I simply transfered it by pouring it.
* I left a bit of wort in the kettle because too much hop cones were about to get dragged with it.
* I ended up with 16L of wort in the fermentor
* I tried to rehydrate the yeast (two packets), as mentioned in John Palmer's book, but I did it too soon and in a small container. I ended up throwing it away, and I just sprinkled a single pack of yeast on top of the wort, as the manifacturer says.
* OG is 1.052, Estimated ABV: 5.56%
* Efficiency estimated at 55% by brewersfriend.com
* TODO: in the checklist, I was missing instructions for preparing the lauter tun and the yeast.
* Removed dryhop at 2017-09-24 (don't remember when I added it, surely about 4 days before, check termomether)
* Need more info on dry hopping. I think next brew shouldn't have dry hopping.
* TODO: in the checklist add the following instruction:
   * Add wort chiller in the kettle 15 minutes before end.
* I sparged the grains with boiling water, would it extract tannins?


* Bottling (2017-10-04):
    * had 15.5 liters, ended up with 16 * 750 ml bottles
    * had a lot of trub, might need to do a second fermentation? Some Might have ended up in bottles
    * FG: 10.010 
    * My tubing is probably too big, when racking there was a lot of bubbles.
    * When sanitizing, I really got the impression that I have too much undissolved product left. some were left on the bottle caps. I generally uncomfortable with that step. Might need advises from someone else.
    * I put 99 grams of white sugar (51g) + some cane sugar (48g). I determined that max temp for wort was 18 degrees.
    * it took 2 hours.
