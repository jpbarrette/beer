* Used Yeast: Fermentis / Safale - American Ale Yeast US-05
* Strike water volume 11.85L, at 75.5C (calculated with [Brewersfriend.com calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/mash/), with ) 
* Mash temperature got down to 64C, I had to add boiling water to get back to 68C
* I rinsed the gains to get up to 24L of wort (calculated with liquid height in kettle: 24.5 cm). Note that I rinsed with boiling water, so it might cause [astringency](http://beersmith.com/blog/2015/10/25/astringency-from-grains-oversparging-and-hot-sparging-your-beer/).
* Preboil gravity was 1.032, estimated OG was 1.0432
* Duration of the boil was 90 minutes (Since estimated OG was low)
* A followed the recipe for hop addition. So late hop was added at flameout, waited 15 minutes, then added the cooler and the second hop addition.
* Amarillo hop was cones, and for the zero minute hop addition, I inadvertently added it without being in a hop bag, -15 minutes addition was in a hop bag. Because of the cones, I couldn't transfer the kettle content through the tap. I simply transfered it by pouring it.
* I left a bit of wort in the kettle because too much hop cones were about to get dragged with it.
* I ended up with 16L of wort in the fermentor
* I tried to rehydrate the yeast (two packets), as mentioned in John Palmer's book, but I did it too soon and in a small container. I ended up throwing it away, and I just sprinkled a single pack of yeast on top of the wort, as the manifacturer says.
* OG is 1.052, Estimated ABV: 5.56%
* Efficiency estimated at 55% by brewersfriend.com
* TODO: in the checklist, I was missing instructions for preparing the lauter tun and the yeast.
