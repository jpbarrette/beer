Original Pale Chocolate (225.0 SRM)
-----------------------------------

http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Products/Dark_Roasted.htm#2RowChocolate

All recipes changes the american pale chocolate by a "united kingdom - pale chocolate" which I'm sure is [Fawcett's pale chocolate](http://www.fawcett-maltsters.co.uk/range.html)


Crisp Malting?
* https://www.rolling-beers.fr/fr/27_crisp-malting

Maybe I can add normal chocolate + coffee from http://www.castlemalting.com/CastleMaltingMalts.asp?P=105&Language=French

* One solution I was looking at was to replace with [Weyermann Carafa Type I (dehusked)](https://bsgcraftbrewing.com/weyermann-carafa-dehusk-1-spec)

Briess Crystal 90L
------------------

* [Description](http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Products/Caramel.htm#90L): Pronounced caramel, slight burnt sugar, raisiny, prunes	 

* From [equivalencies](https://www.brew.is/files/malt.html), I could use CaraAroma, which correspond to Crystal 120 or use [MFB](https://www.malteriesfrancobelges.fr)'s CaraMunich 80.
* https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/caramel-crystal-malts-substitutes.402596/ Chateau Crystal? or [carared](https://bsgcraftbrewing.com/weyermann-carared-25-kg)
* [CaraBohemian](https://bsgcraftbrewing.com/weyermann-cara-bohemian) could be good also (from previous discussion link)
