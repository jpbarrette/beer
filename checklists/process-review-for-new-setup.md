# Mashing

* Warming up water: will take less time
* Test isolation (or do without by using burner)
* Test pulley system
* Check knots:
  * Truckers hitch + girth hitch?

# Boiling

Nothing to change.

# Transfer

use hose barb fitting to send into the cube.
 * sanitize the cube
 * either cold it in the river (use knots to keep it)
 * or let it sit for a night and then put in fridge, to transfer into fermenter. 

# Notes

* since it's using an nochill method, but I was already using less bittering hop, we'll see what the impact will be on IBU.
* no need for funnel (from kettle to hdpe cube it's the hose barb, then it's just pourring in the open mouth fermenter)

# TODO:

## Day Before Brewing

* buy demineralized water (https://www.brassageamateur.com/forum/ftopic34734.html)
* Need rope loops?


* check kettle sealing
* protect the small ss items with starsan 
* buy rope loops
* create an anchor
* check how to use campden?
* Review recipe:
  * 60 minutes mash + 60 boil for now, to let time to wonder the setup
  * target volume 20L
* Check boiloff rate? (but use 4L) (from https://byo.com/article/boiling-advanced-brewing/)
