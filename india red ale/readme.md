# Preparation Notes

* Given the following [article](https://byo.com/article/hop-stands/), I'll add the whirpool hop when I reach 78C and then let it cooldown the whole night.
* I'll add the dry hop loose as the [following article](http://brulosophy.com/2017/07/03/loose-vs-bagged-dry-hops-exbeeriment-results/) seems to point that it doesn't matter much (for my setup).
* I'll add the dry hopping in two pass: after 3 days of fermentation and 4 days before the end. I was scared about the "grassy taste", but [this article](http://brulosophy.com/2015/10/26/dry-hop-length-long-vs-short-exbeeriment-results/) put my mind to peace
* I've changed the pale chocolate malt from the original recipe to Weyermann's "Carafa Special I" (de-husked/unbittered). If you want more details on substitution, you can read the [following article](http://brulosophy.com/2017/08/07/roasted-grains-pt-3-carafa-special-ii-vs-chocolate-malt-exbeeriment-results/), but note that I put Carafa Special I, which color is closer to Briess' pale chocolate malt.
* Reading [this article](https://byo.com/article/the-science-of-step-mashing/), I thought about changing the mashing temp to 67 instead of using the two saccharification rest from the original recipe.
