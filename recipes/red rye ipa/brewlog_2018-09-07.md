Brew Notes

Post Brew Notes
===============

-   Sparkled dry yeast directly without rehydrating
-   (2018/09/15) Fermentor is out of the fridge. Settings for inkbird was 15.2C with 1.0C buffer, 30 minutes cooldown. Avg temp seemed to be 17C for beer itself.

Brew Notes
==========

-   (17h30) Fired kettle (water was boiled before to get rid of chlorine)
-   (18h00) Mashing. Strike water was at 66.8C. With grains, water was at 63.8C. (lost 100/150 mL because of bad manipulation)
-   (18h38) Mashing out. Wort was at 64C. Preboil gravity 1.040 at 58.7C.
-   (19h20) Water is boiling. Adding bittering hop.
-   (19h50) Flame out. Put half of aroma hop. Wort at 98C
-   (20h08) Put second batch of aroma hop at 85C
-   (20h30) 13 Liters in fermentor at 33C. OG 1.060 at 28C.
-   (21h20) Cleanup finished.
-   (2018/07/28 8h) Sprinkled dry yeast in the fermenter.

Post Notes
==========

-   (2018/09/20 22h00) Dry hopping of Simcoe 80g, in a bag.
-   The fact that I had only 13 liters might be due to the fact that I milled the rye very fine. This might have cause the grains to retain more wort than usual. This is consistent with previous red rye ipa.
