Preparation Notes
=================

-   Need to check for sodium: <http://brulosophy.com/2018/01/22/water-chemistry-pt-10-the-impact-of-sodium-on-beer-exbeeriment-results/>. Probably 50ppm would be sufficient.

Brew Notes
==========

-   (11h50) Started setting up, filling 19 Liters of strike water and milling.
-   (12h50) Mash in (took longer than usual because kettle wasn't at max). Strike temp 66.5, got down to 65.1 with grains.
-   (13h50) Getting grains out. Wort is at 64C. Preboil gravity at 1.038 at 60.3 degrees.
-   (13h10) Wort at 75.6, wort is at 18.2cm in the kettle.
-   (14h37) Wort is boiling (took more time, because kettle wasn't at max), put 24g of 14.6% AA Columbus.
-   (15h40) Stopped kettle, started chilling to target temp of 70C for hop stand. Added 81g of 13.9% AA Simcoe at 70C for 30 minutes.
-   (16h22) Started immersion chiller.
-   (16h37) Put wort in fermentor at 27.5 degrees. I didn't put the yeast yet. I put the wort in the basement in an insulation jacket with ice bottles. This will allow the wort to go at reasonable pitching temp. 1.064 OG at 27.5C.
-   (16h50) Cleanup almost done.
-   (23h50) Pitching yeast at 17.5C.
