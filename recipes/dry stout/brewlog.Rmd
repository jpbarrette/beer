 * Look at comments about 3% of soured beer
 * I'd suggest to everyone attempting this or other dry stout recipes to try to adjust your water to a Dublin profile. The high carbonates help to balance the acrid sharpness from the roasted barley and result in that smooth clean flavor the style is famous for.
 * US05?
 * If you listen to Jamil's shows he states a few times that he usually only does a single infusion anyway. With today's highly modified malts you can get away with the single infusion. My 70/20/10 dry stout is mashed at 150*F and it turns out great.
 * No need to grind to dust? Not sure
