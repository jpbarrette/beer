Recipe Changes
--------------

-   I didn't have Carafa II as mentionned in the recipe (I only had Carafa Special II, which isn't the same thing), but since I had chocolate rye, I decided to go with this. It's said to lend more a "milk chocolate" taste, and I wanted to see what it gave in there. Next time I might try with Chocolate Wheat. From BYO's [Chocolate Malt article](https://byo.com/article/chocolate-malt/):
    <blockquote>
    Chocolate rye (~250 °L) and chocolate wheat (~400 °L) are the two biggest non-barley chocolate malts. Although similar to chocolate malt made from barley, the rye version has more spiciness and milk chocolate quality. The wheat version has more of a pronounced dark chocolate character.
    </blockquote>
    We'll see what it'll give, but I suspect that Carafa II would have lending more bitterness, which is desired for this style. Note also that in this recipe I also have [brewferm's "chocolate malt"](https://www.brouwland.com/en/our-products/brewing/malts-and-flakes/roasted-malts/brewferm-chocolate-900-ebc/d/barley-malt-brewferm-chocolate-900-ebc-25-kg)[1], which is described as "roasted nut". We'll see how this will mix togheter. We'll see.
-   Cara60 will be substituted by CaraRye. Weyermann's webpage description:
    <blockquote>
    CARARYE® can be used to impart typical rye flavors and aromas, with the characteristic malty and spicy notes. Intense aromas of bread, coffee, dark chocolate and dried fruit also come through.
    </blockquote>

Preparation Notes
-----------------

-   Used Bru'N'Water spreadsheet to be able to calculate sodium additions. Essentially, I decided to
-   Form BYO's article:
    <blockquote>
    All-grain brewers can use a single infusion mash and a low enough mash temperature so that the resulting beer does not end up too viscous. A temperature range of 148 to 154 °F (64 to 68 °C) works well. Use a lower mash temperature when using lower attenuating yeasts or high starting gravities and use a higher temperature when using the higher attenuating yeasts or lower starting gravity beers.
    </blockquote>
    This means that since I use Safale US-04, which is low attenuating, I'll use a low mash temperature; 65C should be enough. *Wasn't temp just bullshit?*
-   Will add lactic acid and salts before heating (from Bru'N'Water):
    <blockquote>
    For best result, add acids prior to heating the water since heating can drive off a portion of the alkalinity that the acid addition was calculated to remove.
    </blockquote>
-   As original recipe mentions, I'll target a 5.2 mash water pH (4.8 strike water pH).

Questions
---------

-   There's a little bit less sodium that target profile.
    -   Is this a problem
    -   How can I add sodium (<http://brulosophy.com/2018/01/22/water-chemistry-pt-10-the-impact-of-sodium-on-beer-exbeeriment-results/>)?
    -   <https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2008/09/i-think-that-water-treatment-has-made.html>
    -   Which salt to use:

    -   <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1951.tb01621.x>
    -   From Bru'N'Water's [website](https://sites.google.com/site/brunwater/water-knowledge):
        <blockquote>
        Table Salt provides sodium and chloride ions and is readily soluble in water. Non-iodized salt is preferred since iodine is poisonous to yeast. Table salt is also known as sodium chloride and its chemical formula is: NaCl. Table salt does not readily pick up moisture from the air. Non-iodized table salt is available from grocery stores. A table salt addition of 1 gram per gallon, increases the sodium content of the water by about 104 ppm and the chloride content by about 160 ppm. An addition of 1 gram per liter, increases the sodium content of the water by about 393 ppm and the chloride content by about 607 ppm.
        </blockquote>
    -   Iodized salt harms yeast?
    -   canning salt
    -   kosher salt
-   Why 100 minutes of boil?
