American Rye Stout
================

This is the [second iteration](./brewlog_2018-06-28.md) of [Zymurgy
Magazine’s Stout
Trousers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/stout-trousers/).
However, this time around the recipe is highly modified (to a point
where it doesn’t bear any resemblance) to become an American Rye Stout.
This recipe was built and adjusted with [Brewer’s Friend
website](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/698901/american-rye-stout).
The water profile adjustment by reading Michael Tonsmeire’s [Oatmeal
Coffee Stout
\#3](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2013/01/oatmeal-cofee-stout-3-bigger-and-bolder.html)
recipe.

The first recipe had a thin mouthfeel. To remedy that I decided to
confirm a tendency this recipe had, meaning using rye as a “body
builder”.

# Recipe Changes

  - Substracted some pale ale malt to rye malt (500g to 500g) to add
    mouthfeel and push a bit more the rye.
  - Changed sodium target from 50ppm to 100ppm. This lead to a 150ppm
    cloride, but I won’t try to change that. This is appropriate.
  - Simplified the recipe by removing the belgian chocolate malt by some
    already included chocolate rye.
  - Staggered the aroma hop to reflect Michael Tonsmeire’s protocol
    (which was taken from Mitch Steele’s).
  - Changed estimated IBU contribution by aroma hop (was set to zero in
    previous recipe) but also lowered the IBU for that recipe. This
    should reduce significantly the biterness of that recipe.
