I remembered "designing great beers" having a water table for stouts so I looked it up.

They have london and dublin water profiles, the two classic styles for stouts. London water profile is considered best for imperial stouts so I'd recommend it for american as well.

Mineral: London, Dublin
Calcium: 50, 115
Magnesium: 20, 4
Sodium: 100, 12
Carbonate: 160, 200
Sulfate: 80, 55
Chloride: 60, 19



* Black Full in brewnwater
