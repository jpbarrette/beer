American Rye Stout
================

This is the [third iteration](./brewlog_2018-10-19.md) of [Zymurgy Magazine's Stout Trousers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/stout-trousers/). However, this time around the recipe is highly modified (to a point where it doesn't bear any resemblance) to become an American Rye Stout. This recipe was built and adjusted with [Brewer's Friend website](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/895830/american-rye-stout). The water profile adjustment by reading Michael Tonsmeire's [Oatmeal Coffee Stout \#3](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2013/01/oatmeal-cofee-stout-3-bigger-and-bolder.html) recipe.

The first recipe had a thin mouthfeel. To remedy that I decided to confirm a tendency this recipe had, meaning using rye as a "body builder".

I simplified the recipe (rounder quantities) and I lowered down the IBU so that it's calculated as 30 minutes boil, but IBU will be higher because of the nochill method (calculate 40 minutes as mentionned below).

Recipe Changes
==============

-   In this batch, I'll use starsan in the jerry can before putting the hop. This way, I'll just put the jerry can right away in the river to cool down (and not fear infection).

Brewing Notes
=============

-   (18h30) Fired kettle, put salts and acid.
-   (19h14) Mashing, strike water at 71C, mash temp was 69.3
-   (19h45) Getting grains bag out. Preboil gravity 1.042 at 63.5C. 17.7cm of wort depth.
-   (20h20) Worst is boiling; added columbus hop.
-   (20h52) Stopped kettle, fired immersion chiller to bring to whirlpool temp, to then let it at that temperature. Choose 75C since I used Simcoe instead of Cascade hop (6 to 13.9% AA); so I didn't wanted to make it too bitter (lower temp means lower alpha-acid isomerization). Added whirlpool hop for 30 minutes.
-   (21h23) Started cooling. Stopped it when reached 30C (my tap water is around 21C). Put wort in fermentor without putting yeast yet. Put fermenter in fridge (was set at "6" setting).
-   (22h02) Finished cleaning.
-   (2018/09/21 6h30) Added yeast in fermentor. Wort at 11C.
-   (2018/10/16 18h) Cold crashed
