American Rye Stout
================

This is the [second iteration](./brewlog_2018-06-28.md) of [Zymurgy Magazine's Stout Trousers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/stout-trousers/). However, this time around the recipe is highly modified (to a point where it doesn't bear any resemblance) to become an American Rye Stout. This recipe was built and adjusted with [Brewer's Friend website](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/698901/american-rye-stout). The water profile adjustment by reading Michael Tonsmeire's [Oatmeal Coffee Stout \#3](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2013/01/oatmeal-cofee-stout-3-bigger-and-bolder.html) recipe.

The first recipe had a thin mouthfeel. To remedy that I decided to confirm a tendency this recipe had, meaning using rye as a "body builder".

Recipe Changes
==============

-   Substracted some pale ale malt to rye malt (500g to 500g) to add mouthfeel and push a bit more the rye.
-   Changed sodium target from 50ppm to 100ppm. This lead to a 150ppm cloride, but I won't try to change that. This is appropriate.
-   Simplified the recipe by removing the belgian chocolate malt by some already included chocolate rye.
-   Staggered the aroma hop to reflect Michael Tonsmeire's protocol (which was taken from Mitch Steele's).
-   Changed estimated IBU contribution by aroma hop (was set to zero in previous recipe) but also lowered the IBU for that recipe. This should reduce significantly the biterness of that recipe.

Notes
=====

-   <https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/sn-american-stout-water-profile.140344/> I remembered "designing great beers" having a water table for stouts so I looked it up.

They have london and dublin water profiles, the two classic styles for stouts. London water profile is considered best for imperial stouts so I'd recommend it for american as well.

Mineral: London, Dublin Calcium: 50, 115 Magnesium: 20, 4 Sodium: 100, 12 Carbonate: 160, 200 Sulfate: 80, 55 Chloride: 60, 19

Make one small change per brew, omitting the change in the next brew if it doesn't get you closer to your target.

Brewing Notes
=============

-   (18h30) Fired kettle, put salts and acid.
-   (19h14) Mashing, strike water at 71C, mash temp was 69.3
-   (19h45) Getting grains bag out. Preboil gravity 1.042 at 63.5C. 17.7cm of wort depth.
-   (20h20) Worst is boiling; added columbus hop.
-   (20h52) Stopped kettle, fired immersion chiller to bring to whirlpool temp, to then let it at that temperature. Choose 75C since I used Simcoe instead of Cascade hop (6 to 13.9% AA); so I didn't wanted to make it too bitter (lower temp means lower alpha-acid isomerization). Added whirlpool hop for 30 minutes.
-   (21h23) Started cooling. Stopped it when reached 30C (my tap water is around 21C). Put wort in fermentor without putting yeast yet. Put fermenter in fridge (was set at "6" setting).
-   (22h02) Finished cleaning.
-   (2018/09/21 6h30) Added yeast in fermentor. Wort at 11C.
-   (2018/10/16 18h) Cold crashed
