Mad Fermentiationist’s Big Hop IPA
================

This is my interpretation of Pliny the Elder’s recipe. This is inspired
from MadFermentationist’s [own
interpretation](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/12/pliny-younger-clone-recipe.html)
and his own [DIPA Bomb
recipe](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/02/big-ipa-recipe-1-lb-of-hops.html),

# Brew Notes (2018/08/23)

  - Grains where crushed fine. Also, I put the whole milled grains bag
    at the same time. This caused a giant dough ball.
  - Strike water was at 68.5. Had to stir to break that giant dough
    ball. Temp lowered to 64.6 before I managed to cover the kettle.
  - Every fit in the kettle, there’s still space left for 1 liter.
  - (20h18) 35 minutes mash, mash ended at 63.5C.
  - (20h18) Started kettle
  - (20h57) Boil started
  - (21h28) Stopped kettle fire. Put hop.
  - (21h30) I took a sample but too realy. I lost a lot of hop in that
    sample which won’t contribute to the beer.
  - (21h45) Put second batch of hop)
  - (22h00) Started immersion chiller
  - (22h08) Put wort in fermentor at 32C, 14L.
  - (22h10) FG 1.088 at 30C

# Post Notes

  - 2018/09/29 - Got the fermentor out of the fridge, but after 6 hours,
    it was bubling too strongly. Decided to put it back in the fridge to
    let continue fermentation at low temp (17C).
  - 2018/09/02 - Got the fermentor out of the fridge to finish
    fermentation.
  - 2018/09/03 - Beer at 21C, still bubling but weakly that first time I
    got it out of fridge.
