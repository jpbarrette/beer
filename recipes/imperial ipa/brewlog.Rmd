This is my interpretation of Pliny the Elder's recipe. This is inspired from MadFermentationist's [own interpretation](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/12/pliny-younger-clone-recipe.html) and his own [DIPA Bomb recipe](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/02/big-ipa-recipe-1-lb-of-hops.html), [mine](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/686156/imperial-ipa-almost-)
