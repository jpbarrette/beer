# Using coconut in brewing

Neil Fisher, co-owner of WeldWerks Brewing Company, for [Craft Beer and Brewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9IvBx_cwjA):

* flaked unsweetened coconut: toating in oven a pound at a time over a oven sheet, at ~200C (400F), 4 minutes then flip and another 4 minutes. For more info, please look at video

# Using Lactose

I forgot to put the lactose during the boil. So I need to add it while fermenting:

* At maximum density at warmish room temp (25°C), you get a ~ 1.064 lactose-water solution. (Solubility is 216 g/l, whereas sucrose's solubility is 2100 g/l). [ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/54n663/forgot_the_lactose_in_a_sweet_stout_can_i_add/)

## Quantity

Rough guidance for 5 gallons:

* 0.25 lb lactose just takes the edge off dryness
* 0.5 lb lactose begins to taste slightly sweet and full
* 0.75 lb lactose is a good moderate amount to be obvious without overpowering
* 1 lb lactose is positively sweet and full
* >1 lb lactose in 5 gallons tastes over the top syrupy

For milk stout, if not sure how much to use, start with 0.5-0.75 lb in the initial boil. Then on packaging day, give it a taste and if needed, add 0.25 lb at a time until it tastes right to you.
