* Why rice malt: http://www.thebeveragepeople.com/how-to/beer/recipes/ipa-in-any-color.html<blockquote>One particularly useful strategy American brewers have brought to the IPA style is the restrained use of highly fermentable adjuncts (unmalted sugar/ starch sources). If you use 1 lb of rice or corn sugar in a 5 gallon batch of IPA in place of 1 lb of dry malt, it will bring your final gravity down approximately 2 or 3 points. The effect this has on mouthfeel and perceived maltiness in the final beer is significant. Also, the hops are more obvious and enjoyable with less residual sugar to hide it.</blockquote>^[for Black IPA's recipe mentioned in this article, please check [this article](http://www.thebeveragepeople.com/how-to/beer/recipes/ipa-bombay-after-dark-recipe.html)]


For now, let's remove the rice from the recipe and replace it with pale ale malt. Once we are confortable with the recipe, let's check out how to do it. Note that it might be just easier to add raw sugar instead.

Before doing this, please check pH requirements.
