* Why rice malt: http://www.thebeveragepeople.com/how-to/beer/recipes/ipa-in-any-color.html<blockquote>One particularly useful strategy American brewers have brought to the IPA style is the restrained use of highly fermentable adjuncts (unmalted sugar/ starch sources). If you use 1 lb of rice or corn sugar in a 5 gallon batch of IPA in place of 1 lb of dry malt, it will bring your final gravity down approximately 2 or 3 points. The effect this has on mouthfeel and perceived maltiness in the final beer is significant. Also, the hops are more obvious and enjoyable with less residual sugar to hide it.</blockquote>
