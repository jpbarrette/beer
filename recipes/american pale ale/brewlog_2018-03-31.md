BIAB Calculator
===============

Since I use BIAB (Brew in a Bag) method, here's the calculations taken from [BIAB Calculator](http://www.biabcalculator.com/)

Recipe Parameter
----------------

-   Grain Bill: 2.16 Kilograms
-   Grain Temp: 20 Celsius
-   Batch Size: 8.5 Liters
-   Mash Temp: 68 Celsius
-   Boil Time: 60 Minutes

System Variables
----------------

-   Kettle Size: Liters
-   Trub: 0.12 Liters, TODO: show the actual trub + whole hops lost
-   Boiloff Rate: 2.75 Liters/Hour
-   Grain Absorption: 0.48 Liters/Kilograms of grain
-   TODO: Bottled Volume (minus yeast cake)

Recipe Output
-------------

-   Total Water Needed: 12.41 Liters
-   Strike Water Temp: 68.9 Celsius
-   Total Mash Volume: 13.85 Liters
-   Preboil Wort: 11.37 Liters
-   Postboil Wort: 8.62 Liters
-   Into Fermenter: 8.5 Liters
-   Estimated cost: 26.92 (3.17/L)

Preparation Notes
=================

-   From American Homebrewer's Association's blog, there's an [article](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/effect-post-boilwhirlpool-hop-additions-bitterness-beer/) that mentions that I can expect a 3.58% utilization with a 10 minutes whirlpool. This gives us 69.91 IBU, which is a lot for an American Pale Ale. However, as Michael Tonsmeire was saying:
    <blockquote>
    Despite around 50 IBUs, this beer should not be harshly bitter owing to the lower perceived bitterness of late additions.
    </blockquote>
    Note that in his notes, he doesn't take into consideration the IBUs contributed by his whirlpool hops.

Brewing Notes
=============

-   (16h10) Started kettle. Water volume 13L, temperature at 46C, depth 14.8cm.
-   (17h00) Mashing
-   (18h00) Fired kettle boil. Wort at 64C, depth 13.5cm (estimated 12L), preboil gravity: 1.026 (at 60C). Estimated preboil gravitywas 1.034, but with temperature correction, it gives 1.039 (1.026 at 60C, compensated for 20C). With actual OG it seems the formula overestimates?
-   (18h30) Boil started. Note that the boil is stronger this time. Probably because there's less water. Maybe with 12L boiling water the boiloff is greater than my estimated 2.75L/h.
-   (19h30) Added all flameout hop, put kettle lid, and waited 10 minutes before getting hop out of it.
-   (20h00) OG: 1.050, pitched with *Safale - English Ale Yeast S-04* since that's the only yeast I had left.
-   (20h30) Cleaning finished.
-   (2018/04/11, 20h00) Dry Hopped with 17g Centennial, 26 Columbus, 34 Simcoe. I overshot a bit the quantity because I finished some hop bags.
-   (2018/04/15, 20h00) Carbonation target 3.0, 7.8g/L \* 7.25L (8.5L - 1.5L + 0.250L)= 56.55 (rounded down to 56). 7L in racking bucket. 6x750mL + 3x330mL + 1x500mL (6L bottled). 1L lost in racking bucket + 1.50L lost in fermentor.
