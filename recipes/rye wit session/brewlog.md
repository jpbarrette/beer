BIAB Calculator
===============

Since I use BIAB (Brew in a Bag) method, here's the calculations taken from [BIAB Calculator](http://www.biabcalculator.com/)

Recipe Parameter
----------------

-   Grain Bill: 2.31 Kilograms
-   Grain Temp: 20 Celsius
-   Batch Size: 15 Liters
-   Mash Temp: 67 Celsius
-   Boil Time: 30 Minutes

System Variables
----------------

-   Kettle Size: Liters
-   Trub: 0 Liters, TODO: show the actual trub + whole hops lost
-   Boiloff Rate: 2.75 Liters/Hour
-   Grain Absorption: 0.48 Liters/Kilograms of grain
-   TODO: Bottled Volume (minus yeast cake)

Recipe Output
-------------

-   Total Water Needed: 17.48 Liters
-   Strike Water Temp: 67.6 Celsius
-   Total Mash Volume: 19.02 Liters
-   Preboil Wort: 16.38 Liters
-   Postboil Wort: 15 Liters
-   Into Fermenter: 15 Liters
-   Estimated cost: 25.13 (1.68/L)

Preparation Notes
=================

-   I could seperate the water in two kettle to warm faster?
-   I think I should have a lower "liquor-to-grist" ratio on this brew. I might not use the full volume to help alpha amylaze. *UPDATE* I won't do that, but it means the efficiency might be lower. So, 3.3% is good because if I'm going lower, it's okay.
-   For this recipe I want to keep a similiar hop profile than my american pale ale or american wheat ale (but not the IBU). This will allow us to compare the malt profile.
-   Reading the following [article](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2017/06/23-abv-session-neipa.html) from Michael Tonsmeire, I decided to go with the following water profile:
    -   Cloride: 150ppm
    -   Sulfate: 100ppm
    -   Sodium: 50ppm
-   I decided to go with 3% ABV to do a safer bet.

Water Information
=================

-   Target Water Profile:
    -   Sodium: 50ppm
    -   Sulfate: 100ppm
    -   Chloride: 150ppm
    -   Mash pH: 5.35
-   Water Additions:
    -   1.5g Gypsum
    -   2.99 Calcium Chloride (2.3g, but since it's 77%, 2.99g)
    -   2.5g Epsom Salt
    -   4.0ml Lactic Acid (80%)
    -   2.3g Salt
-   Adjusted Water Profile:
    -   Calcium: 113ppm
    -   Magnesium: 17ppm
    -   Sodium: 50ppm
    -   Sulfate: 102ppm
    -   Chloride: 155ppm
    -   Bicarbonate: 34ppm
    -   Estimated Mash pH: 5.38
