# Preparation Notes

* I think I should have a lower "liquor-to-grist" ratio on this brew. I might not use the full volume to help alpha amylaze.
* For this recipe I want to keep a similiar hop profile than my american pale ale or american wheat ale (but not the IBU). This will allow us to compare the malt profile.
