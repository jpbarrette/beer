BIAB Calculator
===============

Since I use BIAB (Brew in a Bag) method, here's the calculations taken from [BIAB Calculator](http://www.biabcalculator.com/)

Recipe Parameter
----------------

-   Grain Bill: 3.76667 Kilograms
-   Grain Temp: 20 Celsius
-   Batch Size: 15 Liters
-   Mash Temp: 67 Celsius
-   Boil Time: 60 Minutes

System Variables
----------------

-   Kettle Size: Liters
-   Trub: 0 Liters, TODO: show the actual trub + whole hops lost
-   Boiloff Rate: 2.75 Liters/Hour
-   Grain Absorption: 0.48 Liters/Kilograms of grain
-   TODO: Bottled Volume (minus yeast cake)

Recipe Output
-------------

-   Total Water Needed: 19.56 Liters
-   Strike Water Temp: 67.9 Celsius
-   Total Mash Volume: 22.07 Liters
-   Preboil Wort: 17.75 Liters
-   Postboil Wort: 15 Liters
-   Into Fermenter: 15 Liters
-   Estimated cost: 36.23956 (2.42/L)

Water Information
=================

-   Target Water Profile:
    -   Sodium: 50ppm
    -   Sulfate: 150ppm
    -   Chloride: 150ppm
    -   Mash pH: 5.35
-   Water Additions:
    -   1.6g Gypsum
    -   3.11g Calcium Chloride (2.4g, but since it's 77%, 3.11g)
    -   5.2g Epsom Salt
    -   4.0ml Lactic Acid (80%) (Was 5.0ml, but since I boiled the water before the mash, I decided to add less acid)
    -   2.4g Salt
-   Adjusted Water Profile:
    -   Calcium: 113ppm
    -   Magnesium: 30ppm
    -   Sodium: 50ppm
    -   Sulfate: 152ppm
    -   Chloride: 155ppm
    -   Bicarbonate: 9ppm
    -   Estimated Mash pH: 5.37

Brew Notes
==========

-   (14h00) Prepared strike water. 24 liters is 22.6cm high in the kettle and water was at 24.6C. Warmed that water to remove chlorine. Stopped it at 75.2C.
-   (17h50) Because of the evaporated water, it's now at 21.5cm, 41C. Readjusted water to get back at 22.6cm.
-   (18h20) Mashing in at 67C. When down to 65.7C.
-   (19h20) Getting the grains out. Wort is at 64.3C. Lost only 1.4C in one hour. 20.8cm at 63.1C. preboil gravity: 1.030. Firing kettle
-   (20h20) Boil started.
-   (21h20) Stopped kettle, cooled down wort to 72C for hop stand. I didn't have enough Amarillo and Citra, so here's the hops I used:
    -   25g Amarillo
    -   25g Citra
    -   25g Cascade
    -   10g Simcoe
-   (21h25) Also, I reserved the following hops for the dry hop:
    -   25g Amarillo
    -   25g Citra
    -   35g Simcoe
-   (21h50) Started immersion chiller. Brought wort at 32C and put it in fermentor. 15.5 liters. OG 1.052. I didn't pitch in the yeast yet. This is because the last degrees to 21C are taking too much water (since my tap water is at 21). I let the wort cooldown during the night.
-   (22h35) Finished cleaning up everything.
-   (7h30) Pitched yeast. Fermentor was at 18.2C.
