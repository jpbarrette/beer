Base of recipe: https://beerandbrewing.com/bavarian-hefeweizen-recipe/, modified with https://braumagazin.de/article/brewing-bavarian-weissbier-all-you-ever-wanted-to-know/ in mind.

The intent is to have more clove, less banana. So given the previous article

* Grain Bill <50%
* Normal gravity
* Mash-in Temp at 35-40C, pH at 6.0, (for Ferulic Acid). Need to clarify: <quote>Ferulic acid production optimum is at 45°C and pH 6,0. Additional conservation of enzymes at mash in temperature of 40°C. Release of ferulic acid and protein degradation at this temperature reduce the banana flavours.</quote>
* Rest Schedule:
    * 45°C rest: 20-25 min
    * (55°C protein rest: 5 min) (optional)
    * 63°C maltose rest: 30-45 min
    * 72°C saccharification rest: 30 min
    * Fermentation 16C-20C (16C)
    * Secondary Fermentation 20C

Acidification done after the Ferulic Acid rest



Later:

* Wheat Caramalt (120 EBC):  The caramel taste of wheat malt up to 120 EBC supports the fruity ester taste and contributes a typical orange color of the light colored wheat beers [Nar09]. Its taste is similar to dark barley cara malts but occasionally is described as a bit rounder due to the missing husks. Used up to 2-3% in light colored wheat beers and up to 15% in dark colored wheat beers.
