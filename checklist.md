### Setup and Mash^[originally taken from [brewer's friend](https://cdn2.brewersfriend.com/brewersfriend_checklist_BIAB.pdf)]

#. Double check all ingredients are on hand for recipe, including prepared yeast starter if applicable.
#. Weigh out and mill grains.
#. Setup brew kettle and brew bag, ensure they are clean.
#. Make sure valves are closed on brew kettle.
#. Fill kettle with water as recipe calls for (\_\_\_ L) and begin heating to strike temperature. :___ C
#. A brewing salts as recipe calls for or to style.
#. When mash water is ready, submerge grain bag and begin mash.
#. Place lid on kettle^[It's okay to let the lid for mashing, however when boiling we can't let the lid in place] and ensure temperature is maintained.
#. Prepare yeast: Prepare an Erlenmeyer flask with 250mL of pre-boiled water at 25-30C.
#. Monitor mash temperature during mash and adjust as necessary.
#. Bring sparge water at 75C.
#. Take yeast out of fridge if using liquid ale yeast.
#. When mash is complete, bring to mash out temp (75C) with hot water, and give things a good stir.
#. Sparge with water at 75C.
#. Remove grain bag from kettle and let drain.

### Boil

* Take a gravity reading. (pre-boil gravity: \_\_\_ , pre-boil wort collected: \_\_\_)
* Fire the kettle and bring to a boil.
* Stir well as hot break occurs to avoid boil over. Start timer when boil starts.
* Kettle Additions - ingredients / hops as recipe calls for:

* With 30 minutes left, rehydrate the moss for 15 minutes
* With 15 minutes left:
  * Submerge wort chiller (if using immersion chiller).
  * Transfer the moss in the wort


### Final Steps
* Sanitize lid of kettle.
* Flame out.
* Hops / Kettle Addition: 30g Mosaic @flameout 90C for 15 minutes.
* Set lid on kettle, activate wort chiller.
* Begin sanitizing primary fermenter, cork, air lock, aeration stone/hose, funnel, wine thief.
* Prepare Yeast Starter
* When wort is cooled to ~70F / 21C, transfer wort into fermenter.
* Aerate wort with aeration stone (or aerate by shaking, rocking, stirring)
* Take hydrometer sample, record the value. Original Gravity: 
* Pitch yeast. Wort Collected: \_\_\_ L
* Fit with airlock or blow off tube for high gravity or dark beers.
* Move fermenter to temperature stable area protected from light.
* Clean up equipment.

### Yeast starter preparation 

* Sprinkle the dry yeast on top (with funnel)
* Cover with a sanitized aluminum sheet
* Wait for 15 minutes
* Gently stir the rehydrated yeast into the water (do not oxygenize)
* Re-cover the flask and wait 15 minutes (It should be pitched in the next 30 minutes after this)
* Swirl the flask to re-suspend the yeast
* Pitch
