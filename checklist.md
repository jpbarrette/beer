### Setup and Mash^[originally taken from [brewer's friend](https://cdn2.brewersfriend.com/brewersfriend_checklist_BIAB.pdf)]

#. Double check all ingredients are on hand for recipe, including prepared yeast starter if applicable.
#. Weigh out and mill grains.
#. Setup brew kettle and brew bag, ensure they are clean.
#. Make sure valves are closed on brew kettle.
#. Fill kettle with water as recipe calls for and begin heating to strike temperature. :___
#. A brewing salts as recipe calls for or to style.
#. When mash water is ready, submerge grain bag and begin mash.
#. Place lid on kettle^[It's okay to let the lid for mashing, however when boiling we can't let the lid in place] and ensure temperature is maintained.
#. Monitor mash temperature during mash and adjust as necessary.
#. Take yeast out of fridge if using liquid ale yeast.
#. When mash is complete, remove grain bag from kettle and let drain.

### Boil

* Take a gravity reading. (pre-boil gravity: \_\_\_ , pre-boil wort collected: \_\_\_)
* Fire the kettle and bring to a boil.
* Stir well as hot break occurs to avoid boil over. Start timer when boil starts.

* With 30 minutes left, rehydrate the moss for 15 minutes
* With 15 minutes left:
    * Submerge wort chiller (if using immersion chiller).
    * Transfer the moss in the wort


### Final Steps
* Sanitize lid of kettle.
* Flame out.
* Hops / Kettle Addition: 30g Mosaic @flameout 90C for 15 minutes.
* Set lid on kettle, activate wort chiller.
* Begin sanitizing primary fermenter, cork, air lock, aeration stone/hose, funnel, wine thief.
* When wort is cooled to ~70F / 21C, transfer wort into fermenter.
* Aerate wort with aeration stone (or aerate by shaking, rocking, stirring)
* Take hydrometer sample, record the value. Original Gravity: 
* Pitch yeast. Wort Collected: 
* Fit with airlock or blow off tube for high gravity or dark beers.
* Move fermenter to temperature stable area protected from light.
* Clean up equipment.
