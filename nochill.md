# Chilling a No-Chill

What about using the cube to put it in the river? then just sanitation should be enough?

Solutions:

 * to lower down the temp: http://brulosophy.com/2015/02/09/a-year-of-no-chill-lessons-from-a-secret-xbmt/#comment-7264 
 * add late hop adding when at 80C: http://brulosophy.com/2015/02/09/a-year-of-no-chill-lessons-from-a-secret-xbmt/#comment-6302

So:

* Remove 20 minutes to each hop additions
* Use 30 minutes boil, but add hop as if it was there for 40 minutes.

* I could get it in the fountain to get it at 80C?

* Whirlpool: FWH? + hopstand, then cube: http://brulosophy.com/2015/02/09/a-year-of-no-chill-lessons-from-a-secret-xbmt/#comment-23694, Strategy: FWH, then do as before (30 minutes boil), then hopstand for 30 minutes with spider, then it should be around 85C, then put in sanitized cube
* No Whilpool: Add whilpool hop in the cube at 80C

Essentially, if I cool down in a few hours (3-4) and pitch morning after it should be okay.
