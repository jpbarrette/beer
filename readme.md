### BIAB

It seems that since I don't use as much water as BIAB requires generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have full volume? Doesn't it screw up the pH?

* Maybe I should a 20 litters mash, then add little water to mash out?


* After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn't really necessary, but in BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency  (168f/75.5556C)

John tells us how to measure pH and what to do with our measurements to improve our beers.

## Tips

* Fine milled grain (almost to flour) [this](http://www.beersmith.com/forum/index.php?topic=11026.msg45014#msg45014), 
* Bulk Sparge: https://byo.com/color/item/403-bulk-up-your-sparge-technique What's good with this, it really explains that I should put a good quantity of water so that we don't have the "Channeling" effect when pourring a little amount.
* Recirculate? Not sure, I'll have to try but same receipe with and without. (Not sure I want a pump that I'll have to clean
* https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/sparging-with-biab
* Prepare for hot break: spray bottle filled with cold water in hand to control the foam over ([from this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=148179)
## NOTES

* I warmed up 11L (approx) of water to 75 degrees (should probably check how hot exactly it should be), and then added it to the kettle so that the kettle was almost full. Note that the temperature was a bit higher than 75C. Stirred for 2 or 3 minutes then drained it. Maybe I should have left it there for 10 minutes.
* TODO: use other fermenter to see how much liquid contains the kettle
* To get the wort to boil, please stir a bit the wort, it's gonna help?
* I started to oxigen the wort directly when trying to chill it, to save some time.
* I can't do the real BIAB "no sparge" because my kettle simply doesn't have the full volume.

FAQ

### Why X minutes boiling time?^[For more information, here's a good [article](https://byo.com/article/boiling-advanced-brewing/) from BYO magazine. The [following article](https://www.homebrewsupply.com/learn/60-90-otherwise-finding-best-boil-time.html) indicates different boiling times depending of style.]

When I first asked myself that question, it was for Mad Fermentationist's [India Red Ale](india red ale/readme.md). The recipe was asking for 75 boiling time.

The reasons why someone would have longer boil time is mentioned in this [thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/90min-vs-60min-boil.87058/) and the [following](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/forum/index.php?topic=7513.0):

* To increase wort carmelization
* To breakdown DMS pre-cusors
* To form and skim hot break prior to 60 minute bittering additions
* To "slightly" increase hop utilization (See Fix, Principles or any brewing software)
* *To facilitate melanoidin creation (longer boils tends to darken the wort and there are maillard reactions taking place producing more melanoidins that enhance the maltiness of the wort)*
* To better improve hot break coagulation
* To better accomodate consequtive batching.
* To allow more time for drinkin' while brewin'.

For the [India Red Ale](india red ale/readme.md), my guess is that we want to facilitate the melanoidin creation. As mentionned in the [following article](https://byo.com/article/boiling-advanced-brewing/):<blockquote>When subjected to the temperature and agitation of boiling, complex reactions occur between sugars and amino acids, producing substances known as melanoidins. These are usually considered pleasant, resulting in flavors typically associated with the browning of meats and bread. Longer boiling times result in increased melanoidin production and are a major cause of wort darkening. It should be noted this is not quite the same thing as sugar caramelization, which requires higher temperatures and less water than what is present during boiling. Caramelization is part of the process that occurs during the production of crystal and other colored malts.</blockquote>

However, from the following articles brulosophy seems to indicate that longer boil time doesn't seem change anything on the flavor:

* http://brulosophy.com/2015/09/14/boil-length-pt-2-pilsner-malt-exbeeriment-results/
* http://brulosophy.com/2017/11/13/boil-length-pt-3-60-minutes-vs-180-minutes-exbeeriment-results/
* http://brulosophy.com/2015/03/11/the-impact-of-boil-length-ale-exbeeriment-results/

I still can reach a conclusion, except that for now I'll accept doing the extra boiling times.

* (big) http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=311884
* Cover kettle with sleeping bag - (maybe I should do the same thing for full volume, or create an isolant)

### Do I need to whirlpool/Do I need to separate the hot break material from the wort?

is this a problem (however I use irish moss)? https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/aSbC3qutQd/hot-break/
