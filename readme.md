### BIAB

It seems that since I don't use as much water as BIAB requires generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have full volume? Doesn't it screw up the pH?

* Maybe I should a 20 litters mash, then add little water to mash out?


* After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn't really necessary, but in BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency  (168f/75.5556C)

* Dry Hopping, need to read a bit more and do it 5 days before end of fermentation
* Need to check why first batch is gushing
* Need to read about priming sugar quantity
* Do I need to recirculate wort?
* Need to experiment or read on [late hopping](http://www.mrmalty.com/late_hopping.php):

## pH


* (From: http://www.basicbrewing.com/index.php?page=basic-brewing-radio-2007) January 11, 2007 - John Palmer on pH - John Palmer, author of How to Brew, walks us through the potentially intimidating topic of pH. John tells us how to measure pH and what to do with our measurements to improve our beers.

## Tips

* Fine milled grain (almost to flour) [this](http://www.beersmith.com/forum/index.php?topic=11026.msg45014#msg45014), 
* Bulk Sparge: https://byo.com/color/item/403-bulk-up-your-sparge-technique What's good with this, it really explains that I should put a good quantity of water so that we don't have the "Channeling" effect when pourring a little amount.
* Recirculate? Not sure, I'll have to try but same receipe with and without. (Not sure I want a pump that I'll have to clean
* https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/sparging-with-biab
* Prepare for hot break: spray bottle filled with cold water in hand to control the foam over ([from this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=148179)
## NOTES

* I warmed up 11L (approx) of water to 75 degrees (should probably check how hot exactly it should be), and then added it to the kettle so that the kettle was almost full. Note that the temperature was a bit higher than 75C. Stirred for 2 or 3 minutes then drained it. Maybe I should have left it there for 10 minutes.
* TODO: use other fermenter to see how much liquid contains the kettle
* To get the wort to boil, please stir a bit the wort, it's gonna help?
* I started to oxigen the wort directly when trying to chill it, to save some time.
* I can't do the real BIAB "no sparge" because my kettle simply doesn't have the full volume.

* 2 gal would be enough to fit completely in the kettle (full volume).
* maybe 2 gals is just enough so that I might have a better boil, without scorching?
* Boil off is more problematic: No sparge, no mash out?
* Cover kettle with sleeping bag - (maybe I should do the same thing for full volume, or create an isolant)
* Hop?

* 1 lb (0.453592 kg) grain occupies 0.32 (0.3028329L) quarts when saturated (according to Promash). So 1Kg fills 0.667632806575072 L.

FAQ

### Why 75 minutes boiling time?

For more information, here's a good [article](https://byo.com/article/boiling-advanced-brewing/) from BYO magazine. The [following article](https://www.homebrewsupply.com/learn/60-90-otherwise-finding-best-boil-time.html) indicates different boiling times depending of style. The reason why you would need more boiling time is mentioned in this [thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/90min-vs-60min-boil.87058/) and the [following](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/forum/index.php?topic=7513.0):

* To increase wort carmelization
* To breakdown DMS pre-cusors
* To form and skim hot break prior to 60 minute bittering additions
* To "slightly" increase hop utilization (See Fix, Principles or any brewing software)
* To facilitate melanoidin creation (longer boils tends to darken the wort and there are maillard reactions taking place producing more melanoidins that enhance the maltiness of the wort)
* To better improve hot break coagulation
* To better accomodate consequtive batching.
* To allow more time for drinkin' while brewin'.

However, from the following articles brulosophy seems to indicate that it doesn't change anything:
