* preboil: gravity: 1.032, volume was at 26.5 cm
* When cooling down the wort, I added the whirpool's hop at 88C
* We had problems with water cooler, so we stopped and transfered directly (kettle was stuck by hop). We decided to cool it off in the appartement. On the morning it was at 27C.
* Started at 19h30
* 2.068Kg of pale ale malt
* 1.932Kg of wheat malt
* We lost 1L of wort because there wasn't enough place in the kettle.
* 80 minutes mash (had to adjust the temp by adding water very often, but we stirred every 10/15 minutes)
* 9g of columbus
* 13g of Mosaic (pellet)
* 13g of Amarillo (whole)
* It started the boil at 22h20
* 70 minutes boil
* 21.3L in the fermenter
* I have the impression that the boil isn't strong enough
