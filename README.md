### Astringency (Oversparging/Hot Sparging)

### BIAB

It seems that since I don't use as much water as BIAB requires generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have full volume? Doesn't it screw up the pH?

* After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn't really necessary, but in BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency  (168f/75.5556C)

# TODO

* I need to read a bit more about pitching rate?
* Dry Hopping, need to read a bit more and do it 5 days before end of fermentation
* Need to check why first batch is gushing
* Need to read about priming sugar quantity
* Do I need to recirculate wort?

## pH


* (From: http://www.basicbrewing.com/index.php?page=basic-brewing-radio-2007) January 11, 2007 - John Palmer on pH - John Palmer, author of How to Brew, walks us through the potentially intimidating topic of pH. John tells us how to measure pH and what to do with our measurements to improve our beers.
