## Mashing 

### Astringency (Oversparging/Hot Sparging)

### BIAB

It seems that since I don't use as much water as BIAB requires generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have full volume? Doesn't it screw up the pH?

* After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn't really necessary, but in BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency  (168f/75.5556C)
